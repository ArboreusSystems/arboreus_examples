Step by step Swift integration for Xcode Objc-based project:

1) Create new *.swift file (in Xcode) or add it by using Finder.
2) Create an Objective-C bridging header when Xcode asks you about that.
3) Implement your Swift class:

import Foundation

// use @objc or @objcMembers annotation if necessary
class Foo {
    //..
}

4) Open Build Settings and check these parameters:

    * Defines Module : YES
    Copy & Paste parameter name in a search bar

    * Product Module Name : myproject
    Make sure that your Product Module Name doesn't contain any special characters

    * Install Objective-C Compatibility Header : YES
    Once you've added *.swift file to the project this property will appear in Build Settings

    * Objective-C Generated Interface Header : myproject-Swift.h
    This header is auto-generated by Xcode

    * Objective-C Bridging Header : $(SRCROOT)/myproject-Bridging-Header.h
    
5) Import Swift interface header in your *.m file.

#import "myproject-Swift.h"
Don't pay attention to errors and warnings.

6) Clean and rebuild your Xcode project.
